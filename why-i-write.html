                                style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;">
                        </div>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">I do not remember the exact moment I decided to write, but I
                            do remember the feeling, the heavy ache of words pressing against me, refusing to stay
                            hidden. Writing began not as a choice, but as an instinct. I wrote because silence was too
                            heavy to carry alone.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">It wasn’t loneliness that drew me to the page, but rather the
                            unshakable thought that no one could ever fully understand the depth of what I felt. There
                            were emotions too delicate, too complicated, too raw to be spoken aloud. So I turned to
                            language. I began to weave those tangled threads into sentences, trusting that words could
                            capture what my voice could not. Writing became my way of preserving the intensity of
                            feelings that might otherwise dissolve, unacknowledged and unseen.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">But it isn’t only this desire for expression that keeps me
                            writing. I write because beauty stirs me, the subtle music of language, the way words can
                            bend and break yet still hold light. A single phrase can change the texture of a day, and I
                            am always chasing that kind of transformation.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">I write to remember. To hold still what otherwise slips away,
                            the fleeting glance, the quiet strength behind someone’s smile, the invisible weight of
                            unspoken feelings. In writing, I become an archivist of both sorrow and wonder.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Yet above all, I write to resist forgetting myself. The world
                            has a way of pushing people into silence, of demanding conformity. Writing becomes my
                            rebellion, my way of saying I exist, I feel, I dream differently. Like Orwell, I too am
                            driven by a sense of injustice, though mine is often quieter, born of the small betrayals
                            and unvoiced truths that shape our lives.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">And perhaps, selfishly, I write because I long to be
                            understood. To send fragments of myself out into the world, hoping that someone, somewhere,
                            will recognize the pulse behind the words and know they are not alone.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">In the end, I write for survival. For beauty. For connection.
                            For truth. And for that mysterious, unrelenting demon within me who insists that a life
                            without words would not be my life at all.</p>
