                    </h1>

                    <div class="content" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">I walked into the first lecture thinking language was simply a
                            tool we use to express thoughts. I walked out realizing it’s also a tool that shapes them.
                            That shift in perspective is what stayed with me the most. Discourse, as we discussed, isn’t
                            just about sentences or grammar, it’s about how language operates within real-life
                            situations, social structures, and power relations.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What struck me was the idea that context is everything. I kept
                            thinking about how in Pakistan, the phrase “boys will be boys” is treated like a harmless
                            joke. On the surface, it’s just a casual line. But through a discourse lens, it normalizes
                            male misbehavior, excuses harassment, and quietly blames girls for “not being careful
                            enough.” The same words in a different social context say, in a women’s rights rally, would
                            be quoted with sarcasm to expose patriarchy. Same sentence, totally different function and
                            meaning because the context shifts.</p>

                        <div class="gallery-collage-3">
                            <img src="journal_entry_1_img1.jpg"
                                alt="Protest sign reading Boys will be boys what they are taught">
                            <img src="journal_entry_1_img2.jpg"
                                alt="Banner reading If boys will be boys then women will be presidents">
                            <img src="journal_entry_1_img3.jpg" alt="Boys will be boys movie poster">
                        </div>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The lecture also challenged the comforting belief that
                            language is neutral. It really isn’t. Even everyday phrases carry ideology. In Pakistan,
                            this becomes very visible in political and media discourse. A statement like “national
                            interest” sounds neutral and harmless, but it often hides very specific agendas. When
                            politicians use this phrase, it usually discourages questioning almost as if disagreeing
                            becomes unpatriotic. That made me realize how cleverly discourse can silence opposition
                            without explicitly doing so.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">We also talked about the functions of discourse, how it
                            informs, persuades, and sometimes controls. Looking around, it’s hard not to notice how
                            often language is used to normalize inequality or justify authority. This lecture made me
                            more alert, more suspicious in a healthy way. It left me asking: when I hear something
                            repeatedly, am I accepting reality or just accepting a well-packaged discourse?</p>
