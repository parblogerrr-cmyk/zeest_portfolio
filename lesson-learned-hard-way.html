                        Way
                    </h1>

                    <div class="content" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">I used to believe that saying “yes” to everything was the path
                            to growth. Every opportunity felt important, every responsibility felt like a test of my
                            capability. So, I kept agreeing, to lead, to host, to organize, to support, to be present
                            even when I was exhausted. I thought that the more I handled, the more worthy I became. I
                            didn’t realize that sometimes, the hardest lessons arrive quietly, disguised as our own
                            eagerness to prove ourselves.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">There was a time when I believed that strength meant never
                            breaking. People knew me as composed, confident, and in control. They saw the poise, the
                            smile, the effortless presence on stage. They didn’t see the weight I carried when the
                            lights went off, the anxiety that settled in my bones, or the fatigue that followed me home
                            like a shadow.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The lesson came slowly, and painfully. I learned that when you
                            keep giving without pause, you eventually run empty. I had mistaken endurance for purpose,
                            and silence for resilience.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">But the truth is simple: you cannot pour from an empty heart.
                            Stepping back is not failure. Rest is not weakness. Caring for yourself is also a
                            responsibility, one that cannot be postponed.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Strength, I realized, is not how long you keep standing, but
                            how gently you hold yourself when you finally allow yourself to rest.</p>
