                        Feels “Normal”</h1>

                    <div class="content" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; ">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">At some point, I stopped asking why certain things felt normal
                            and started asking who taught me they were. This week I felt it impossible to ignore how
                            deeply discourse shapes our perceptions, so deeply that constructed realities begin to feel
                            natural, unquestionable, and permanent.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">We discussed how reality itself is created through discourse,
                            and gender was one of the clearest examples. From childhood, we are surrounded by language
                            that quietly assigns roles. Nursery rhymes like “Daddy goes to office, Mommy stays at home”
                            may sound harmless, but they repeatedly link masculinity with productivity and femininity
                            with care work. Long before children understand social theory, they’ve already absorbed a
                            worldview.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Brand culture plays a similar role. Cleaning products marketed
                            to women and tech products marketed to men reinforce ideas about who belongs where. Even
                            jokes contribute. Casual remarks like “women can’t park” or “men don’t cry” are often
                            dismissed as humor, yet they repeatedly frame behavior as natural rather than learned.</p>

                            <img src="journal_entry_6_img1.jpg" alt="Cartoon: Just wait until your mother gets home">

                        </div>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What unsettled me most was realizing how early and subtly this
                            conditioning begins. Discourse doesn’t shout; it whispers, repeats, and settles in. This
                            lecture made me more alert to the language around me and more responsible for the language I
                            use. If words can build realities, then choosing them carelessly isn’t harmless at all.</p>
