                    <h1 class="section-title" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Politeness Has a Rank</h1>

                    <div class="content" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">One thing I am very clear about politeness is that it is not
                            evenly distributed, it follows power. Who gets to be direct, who has to soften their words,
                            and who must stay silent often depends less on personality and more on position.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">We discussed how power influences politeness strategies and I
                            immediately thought of classrooms, offices, and even family settings in Pakistan. A teacher
                            can say, “Submit this today,” without sounding rude but a student saying the same would be
                            labelled disrespectful. The difference isn’t linguistic correctness, it’s authority. Those
                            with power can afford to threaten face because their own face is already protected.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This imbalance shows up strongly in workplaces. Junior
                            employees often wrap requests in layers of politeness—“If it’s not too much trouble…” or
                            “Whenever you find time…”—even when the task is urgent. Seniors, however, can issue commands
                            with minimal softening. Politeness here becomes a survival strategy, not a choice.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Gender complicates this further. In Pakistani society, women
                            are often expected to remain polite regardless of their position. A woman being direct risks
                            being labelled “rude” or “arrogant,” while the same tone in a man is interpreted as
                            confidence. The discourse of politeness ends up reinforcing existing power structures
                            instead of simply managing interaction.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What I realized is that we rarely question why respect flows
                            upward more than downward. This lecture made me see politeness not as moral goodness, but as
                            a social tool, one that can maintain harmony, yes, but also quietly preserve inequality.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">So, if politeness always bends toward power, is it really
                            about kindness or about control?</p>
