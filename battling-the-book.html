                        Myself
                    </h1>

                    <div class="content" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Reading Lee Gutkind’s “Battling the Book” felt less like
                            reading an essay and more like overhearing a confession I had been afraid to make myself.
                            From the opening, his tone is intimate, raw, and almost obsessive, capturing what it means
                            to be mentally trapped inside a piece of writing. When Gutkind describes the book as
                            something that “stalks you,” I immediately recognized that feeling. An unfinished piece does
                            not stay on the page; it follows you into your thoughts, your rest, and even your silence.
                            His honesty about resentment, exhaustion, and self-doubt made the essay unsettling but
                            deeply relatable, as if he were articulating a struggle many writers carry quietly.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What stood out to me most was how Gutkind structures the essay
                            around emotional states rather than time. The movement from excitement to frustration, then
                            to surrender and acceptance, closely resembles my own experience with writing. I often begin
                            with clarity and confidence, only to feel overwhelmed halfway through, unsure of whether the
                            work will ever come together. Gutkind’s metaphors turn this inner conflict into something
                            tangible. The book becomes a living force, not merely an object, demanding patience and
                            persistence. Through this imagery, he shows how creativity can feel less like freedom and
                            more like endurance.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The strength of the essay lies in Gutkind’s willingness to
                            admit what writers are rarely encouraged to say aloud: that writing can feel suffocating,
                            obsessive, and emotionally draining. At times, he tells us directly about his exhaustion,
                            yet these moments are balanced by powerful images that show the psychological weight of the
                            process. However, I found myself wanting more from the ending. While Gutkind reaches
                            acceptance, the essay closes quickly, leaving the moment of renewal or relief largely
                            unexplored. I wanted to see how he reconnects with purpose after being so deeply worn down
                            by the work.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Still, the essay succeeds in making the struggle feel
                            universal. Even beyond writing, it speaks to anyone who has felt imprisoned by their own
                            ambitions or responsibilities. For me, “Battling the Book” reframes writing as an act of
                            quiet resilience rather than inspiration. It reminds me that struggle does not mean I am
                            failing as a writer; it means I am engaged. Writing often feels like standing before a
                            mirror that keeps asking uncomfortable questions. I lose direction, feel drained, and doubt
                            myself, yet I return to the page. Like Gutkind, I am learning that persistence is not
                            glamorous, but it is the truest form of victory a writer achieves.</p>
