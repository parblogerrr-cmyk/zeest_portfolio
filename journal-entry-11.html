                    <div class="content" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; ">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">As a child, I used to wish there was a shortcut to writing,
                            some clever system where a few symbols could capture everything we meant. Words felt slow,
                            repetitive, and inefficient. Sitting in this lecture on Jefferson’s Transcription
                            Conventions, I felt oddly nostalgic. It was like revisiting that childhood fantasy, but this
                            time with academic legitimacy.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What fascinated me about Jefferson’s notation system is how
                            seriously it takes ordinary talk. Things we usually ignore like pauses, overlaps, stretched
                            sounds, laughter, hesitation suddenly matter. A small pause isn’t just silence, it can
                            signal discomfort, resistance, or thinking. Overlapping speech can show excitement,
                            impatience, or power. Jefferson’s symbols don’t simplify language, they slow it down so we
                            can actually see what’s happening.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">At first, the system looked intimidating, brackets, colons,
                            timed pauses but then it made sense. Human conversation is messy, and pretending it’s neat
                            through standard writing feels dishonest. This notation doesn’t just record what was said
                            rather it captures how it was said. And that “how” often carries more meaning than the words
                            themselves.</p>

                            <img src="journal_entry_11_music.jpg" alt="Musical manuscript transcription"
                                class="featured-image" style="margin-bottom: 0; height: 100%;">

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What I appreciated most was how critical this approach is. It
                            refuses to treat speech as casual or accidental. By transcribing talk so precisely,
                            Jefferson forces us to confront interaction as structured, patterned, and meaningful. My
                            childhood wish for symbols wasn’t about laziness, it was about efficiency. Jefferson’s
                            system goes further: it shows that meaning lives in the smallest details we usually rush
                            past.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This lecture reminded me that even silence speaks, if we know
                            how to read it.</p>
