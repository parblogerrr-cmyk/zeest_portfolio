                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Reading Jamaica Kincaid’s “Girl” felt less like encountering a
                            short story and more like listening to a familiar voice I have heard in different forms
                            throughout my own life. The single, unbroken sentence mirrors the way advice and warnings
                            are often delivered to girls, not as dialogue, but as a relentless stream that allows little
                            room for response or refusal. As I moved through the mother’s commands about cooking,
                            cleanliness, posture, and behavior around men, I was struck by how closely these
                            instructions resemble the everyday lessons meant to shape a “proper” woman. The girl’s brief
                            attempts to speak stood out to me because they echo how easily a young girl’s voice is
                            dismissed when it challenges inherited authority. What unsettled me most was the repeated
                            fear of the girl becoming “a slut,” a word that reveals how deeply female worth is tied to
                            sexual restraint and social judgment. The mother’s tone feels harsh, yet I could not read it
                            as purely cruel, instead, it seems rooted in fear and experience, as though survival depends
                            on obedience to these rules. Food, domestic labor, and bodily discipline become symbols of
                            respectability and safety, reminding me how tradition often disguises control as care. By
                            using the second-person point of view, Kincaid places the reader directly in the daughter’s
                            position, making the pressure intimate and unavoidable.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Ultimately, “Girl” made me reflect
                            on how gendered expectations are passed down quietly and persistently, shaping identity long
                            before one has the language or freedom to resist them.</p>
