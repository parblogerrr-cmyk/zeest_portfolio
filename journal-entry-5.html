                        Same as Speaking Right</h1>

                    <div class="content" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This week I was challenged something I had always assumed
                            that, being fluent meant being effective. I’ve seen people spending years working on
                            vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, but communicative competence made me realize that
                            accuracy alone doesn’t guarantee successful communication.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What stood out was how competence operates on multiple levels
                            at once. Grammatical knowledge matters, of course, but it’s only one part of the picture.
                            Knowing how to structure a sentence doesn’t tell you whether it should be said, how
                            directly, or in what tone. I started noticing this gap in everyday academic and professional
                            interactions.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">For example, in formal emails, many students (including myself
                            at times) write sentences that are grammatically perfect but pragmatically off. A line like
                            “Send me the document today” isn’t incorrect, yet it ignores sociolinguistic expectations of
                            politeness and hierarchy. Adding mitigation doesn’t weaken the message; it strengthens its
                            acceptability within that discourse community.</p>

                        <img src="journal_entry_5_img3.jpg" alt="Classroom discussion" class="featured-image">

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The lectures also highlighted discourse competence, the
                            ability to maintain coherence and relevance. I realized how often communication fails not
                            because of wrong words, but because ideas aren’t framed in ways listeners expect. Strategic
                            competence felt especially practical, it’s the ability to repair misunderstandings,
                            rephrase, or adapt when communication breaks down (and most people lack this one). It made
                            me rethink that effective communication isn’t about showing how much language you know
                            rather it’s about knowing how to fit language into real situations.</p>
