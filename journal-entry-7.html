                        Mean Knowing a Language</h1>

                    <div class="content" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This lecture instantly reminded me of a friend who proudly
                            claimed he “knew” German and Chitrali. His proof? A handful of words. He would randomly drop
                            Danke or Ja into conversations and occasionally throw in a Chitrali word no one else
                            understood. The confidence was impressive. The competence—questionable. Still, everyone
                            around him was convinced, mostly because no one could challenge him.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">That story made the idea of linguistic repertoire much more
                            real. A linguistic repertoire isn’t about mastering one language perfectly, it’s the
                            collection of linguistic resources we draw from different languages, dialects, registers,
                            accents, and even borrowed words. My friend didn’t actually know those languages, but he had
                            acquired enough fragments to perform multilingualism socially.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">We also discussed how effective communication relies on shared
                            expectations, which brought in Grice’s Cooperative Principle. Communication works because we
                            assume others are being relevant, truthful, clear, and informative enough. I had a teacher
                            who regularly violated the maxim of quantity, she provided too little meaningful information
                            and sometimes manner, since his random insertions confused more than clarified. Yet,
                            conversations still worked because people cooperated by pretending to understand.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This made me realize how flexible communication actually is.
                            We constantly fill gaps, ignore violations, and adjust meanings to keep interaction going.
                            Linguistic repertoires aren’t just linguistic, they’re social performances. This lecture
                            reminded me that language isn’t only about correctness; it’s about participation,
                            impression, and negotiation.</p>
