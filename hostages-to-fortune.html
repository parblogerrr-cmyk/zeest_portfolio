                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">There is a saying that having a family is like giving hostages
                            to fortune. I never truly understood it until I looked at my younger siblings and felt that
                            familiar, terrifying pull in my chest—the overwhelming need to protect them, coupled with
                            the paralyzed realization that I cannot protect them from everything.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">When I first read Bacon’s statement that a man with a wife and
                            children gives “hostages to fortune,” I understood it on both practical and philosophical
                            levels. In my own observation, the idea rings true in many cases. For instance, I have seen
                            family friends refuse high-risk opportunities abroad because leaving their children and
                            spouses would bring too much uncertainty. One close friend even abandoned a promising
                            startup idea, fearing financial instability might harm his children’s future. Such examples
                            show how family responsibilities can limit bold actions or adventurous pursuits, aligning
                            with Bacon’s argument.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">However, a critical view reveals that this “limitation” is not
                            entirely negative. Families often provide motivation, discipline, and purpose. Teachers,
                            mentors, and relatives I know have pursued further education or career advancement precisely
                            to secure a better life for their children. In these cases, the presence of family does not
                            restrain ambition; rather, it channels effort toward meaningful, sustainable goals.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Ultimately, Bacon’s claim highlights the tension between
                            personal freedom and responsibility. While having a family may restrict certain risks, it
                            also fosters dedication, foresight, and moral accountability. Life shows that family can be
                            both a restraint and a source of profound inspiration.</p>
