                        Words</h1>

                    <div class="content" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">I used to think identity was something fixed, something we
                            simply are. This course made me realize how much of it is actually something we are told,
                            repeatedly, through discourse. The way the world is described to us slowly becomes the way
                            we see ourselves in it.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">We discussed how discourse constructs worldviews and
                            identities, and once that idea settled in, it became impossible for me to ignore. For
                            instance, in Pakistan, the repeated discourse of being a “developing nation” or a “fragile
                            democracy” doesn’t just describe reality, it shapes expectations. It subtly lowers the bar.
                            When corruption or poor governance is framed as “normal for a country like ours,” that
                            discourse produces resignation rather than resistance. I’ve caught myself accepting things
                            simply because I’ve heard them described that way for years.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">On an international level, the discourse around Muslims after
                            9/11 is a striking example. Words like terror suspect, radicalized, or moderate Muslim
                            didn’t just label actions; they created our identities. Entire communities were pushed into
                            defensive positions, constantly having to prove harmlessness. That discourse didn’t emerge
                            naturally rather it was produced, repeated, and normalized through global media.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What disturbed me most was realizing how easily discourse
                            divides people into categories: “us” and “them,” “civilized” and “backward,” “empowered” and
                            “oppressed.” Even gender identities are shaped this way. When leadership is consistently
                            described in masculine terms, women who step into those roles are seen as exceptions rather
                            than norms.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This lecture forced me to ask an uncomfortable question: how
                            much of who I think I am is actually my own and how much has been quietly written for me
                            through language?</p>
