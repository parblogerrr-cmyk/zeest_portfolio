                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Sometimes you can ruin a relationship without raising your
                            voice, all it takes is being too direct. This lecture made me realize how much of our daily
                            communication is actually a careful performance designed to protect something invisible but
                            precious: face.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">We talked about positive and negative face needs, and
                            suddenly, everyday conversations made sense. Positive face is our need to be liked,
                            respected, and included. Negative face is our need for space, autonomy, and not being
                            imposed upon. Almost every interaction feels like a negotiation between the two. Asking
                            someone for help, disagreeing with a senior, or refusing an invitation each of these
                            threatens someone’s face in some way.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">In the Pakistani context, face-threatening acts are often
                            softened almost theatrically. Instead of saying, “You’re wrong,” we say, “I might be
                            mistaken, but…” Instead of refusing directly, we say, “InshaAllah, we’ll see.” These aren’t
                            signs of dishonesty, they’re politeness strategies carefully chosen to protect relationships
                            and hierarchies.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">A very real example is how students speak to teachers. Even a
                            simple request like deadline extension turns into a small essay filled with apologies,
                            explanations, and respect markers. Directness here would be seen as disrespect, not
                            efficiency. On the other hand, elders can be blunt without consequences, the power imbalance
                            allows their face to remain intact.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What fascinated me most was realizing how exhausting
                            politeness can be. We constantly calculate tone, wording, and timing to avoid embarrassment,
                            our own or someone else’s. This lecture didn’t just explain politeness rather it exposed the
                            emotional labor behind it. In trying so hard to save face, we sometimes forget to say what
                            we actually mean.</p>
