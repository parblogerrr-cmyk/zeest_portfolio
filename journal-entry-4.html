                    <div class="content" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">I’ve often heard people describe cultural shock as clothes, or
                            customs but this lecture made me realize that one of the biggest shocks is conversation
                            itself. The confusion of not knowing when to speak, how much to say, or how to end a
                            conversation can feel strangely disorienting, even when everyone is technically speaking the
                            same language.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">We explored how discourse changes across cultures,
                            particularly through the lens of high-context and low-context communication. In high-context
                            cultures like Pakistan, meaning is rarely spelled out. Much of it lives in shared
                            understanding, relationships, tone, and pauses. A long silence isn’t awkward, it can be
                            respectful. A vague response might be kinder than a direct refusal. On the other hand,
                            low-context cultures prioritize clarity. Saying exactly what you mean is expected, and
                            indirectness can be mistaken for confusion or even dishonesty.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The differences become especially noticeable in how
                            conversations open and close. In Pakistani discourse, greetings are extended, layered, and
                            relational. Asking about family or health isn’t filler, it’s part of the communicative
                            ritual. Closing a conversation also involves reassurance, politeness, and often prayer. In
                            contrast, many Western contexts allow conversations to start and end quickly, without
                            emotional framing.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The idea of the ethnography of communication helped me
                            understand that these patterns aren’t personal habits but cultural systems. Every culture
                            has its own “rules” for interaction, rules we follow unconsciously until we step outside
                            them.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This lecture left me thinking about my own assumptions. I now
                            pause before judging, maybe the other person isn’t being abrupt, they’re just following a
                            different discourse, a different rhythm of conversation.</p>
