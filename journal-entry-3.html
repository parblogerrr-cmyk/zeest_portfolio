                        They Say</h1>

                    <div class="content" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This lecture was surprisingly fun, but also quietly
                            unsettling. It started with a simple dialogue “Could you pass the salt?” and somehow ended
                            with me questioning how often we misunderstand each other without even realizing it. The
                            sentence itself is polite, grammatically correct, and harmless. Yet, as our teacher showed,
                            its form asks about ability, while its function is a request. When B answered “Yes” and
                            continued eating, it felt absurd but also familiar.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What this example made clear is that meaning doesn’t live in
                            grammar alone. We rely heavily on shared social understanding to interpret what people
                            intend, not just what they say. Discourse works because we usually cooperate in filling
                            these gaps. When that cooperation fails, communication collapses in the most awkward ways.
                        </p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">I began thinking about how often this happens in real life,
                            especially in institutional or formal settings. For instance, when a university
                            administration says, “Students are advised to maintain discipline,” it looks like friendly
                            guidance on the surface. But functionally, it often operates as a warning. The form sounds
                            optional; the function is anything but.</p>

                        <div class="gallery-grid-2">
                            <img src="journal_entry_3_img2.jpg" alt="Meme: Can you pass the semester?"
                                class="featured-image" style="margin-bottom: 0; height: 100%;">
                            <img src="journal_entry_3_img1.png" alt="Students are advised to maintain discipline"
                                class="featured-image" style="margin-bottom: 0; height: 100%;">
                        </div>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">It made me more aware of how politeness, indirectness, and
                            convention shape communication. We rarely speak directly, yet we somehow expect others to
                            understand us perfectly. That expectation itself is fascinating. It made me realize that
                            miscommunication isn’t always about language deficiency, it’s about mismatched assumptions.
                        </p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What interested me most was how fragile understanding actually
                            is. If meaning depends so much on shared norms, what happens when those norms differ? How
                            much do we assume rather than understand when we listen?</p>
