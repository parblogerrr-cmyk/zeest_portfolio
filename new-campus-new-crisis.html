                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The first week at the new campus felt less like stepping into
                            a place of learning and more like walking into a hospital ward. The walls, painted in shades
                            that do nothing but dull the eye, stood in stiff silence. The building itself, just one lone
                            block dropped in the middle of a restless construction sit, seemed to mock the very idea of
                            a “campus.” There is nothing sprawling, nothing welcoming, nothing that breathes of growth.
                            Instead, it feels confined, a structure standing awkwardly, as if unsure of its own purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">And yet, within this uninspiring shell, there are surprises.
                            The classrooms, to my relief, are airy and washed with light. Sunlight spills through wide
                            windows, softening the sterile atmosphere, as if reminding me that even in lifeless walls,
                            warmth can find its way. I sit in these rooms and notice how space and light can change
                            everything the same lecture, the same faces, but somehow made gentler by the openness.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Still, what I am most thankful for is not the light or the
                            architecture, but the people. The place has changed, but the familiar faces remain. In their
                            laughter, in their easy presence beside me, I find the texture of home. Their company
                            cushions the starkness of this new space. The building may fail to inspire, but the people
                            around me keep me grounded, keep me belonging.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">So my first week here is a paradox, an ugly building, yet
                            bright rooms; a barren site, yet a circle of warmth. Perhaps that is the lesson this campus
                            is already teaching me: place matters less than the people who fill it.</p>
