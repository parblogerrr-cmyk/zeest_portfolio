                    <div class="content" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">We didn’t set out that day looking for something dramatic.
                            Honestly, we chose fear because it felt like a topic people would talk about without running
                            away. But as we walked around campus, it became clear that there was something else behind
                            our choice too, maybe a bit of morbid curiosity. Fear is one of those emotions we don’t
                            unpack unless we’re forced to. It sits quietly inside us, unaddressed, and bringing it into
                            conversation felt almost like opening a sealed box. A vulnerable act, but an interesting
                            one.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">So we began moving from spot to spot across Air University,
                            carrying this question with us. The campus looked normal enough, students scattered around,
                            the usual café noise, the lazy afternoon breeze but every person we approached seemed to be
                            carrying their own private fear.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Our first encounter was on the library steps. A girl sat there
                            hugging her backpack like it was something she needed to stay steady. When we asked her what
                            fear meant to her, she let out a short laugh and said, “If fear were a person, it would look
                            like Netanyahu.” She said it quietly, as if even the name carried weight. Her fingers kept
                            moving on the zipper, and even though she was smiling, you could tell the topic made her
                            uneasy. That moment made fear feel strangely personal like someone she had already met
                            somewhere in her life.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">A little later, near the main gate, we met fear again but this
                            time, it actually moved. A girl stopped suddenly, held our arm, and stared at a cat slowly
                            crossing the pavement. “That’s fear,” she whispered. “If it were anything, it would be just
                            like this.” The cat kept walking, minding its own business, unaware of the reaction it
                            caused. The girl didn’t breathe properly until it disappeared. Her fear didn’t come from
                            memories or ideas. It had fur, sharp looks, and silent steps.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The last conversation took place on a quiet bench. A boy sat
                            there, looking ahead instead of at us. When we asked him what fear meant, he didn’t describe
                            a person or creature. He said, “Not reaching my potential. Wasting time. Not being enough.”
                            His voice wasn’t shaky, it felt tired, like he had already thought about it too many times.
                            His fear lived inside him, not outside.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">By the time we were heading back with our notebook full,
                            something had changed. We started this assignment thinking fear was one simple thing. But
                            every answer showed us something different, fear could be political, physical, personal, or
                            quietly painful.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">And somewhere between the café chatter and the library
                            silence, we understood one more thing: fear isn’t just what scares us. It’s what exposes us,
                            our hopes, our weaknesses, our values. All of us carry different fears, but somehow, that’s
                            the very thing that connects us.</p>
